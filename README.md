# CarRental

## Description

This Java application project was developed as part of the **ISIS1226 Diseño y Programacion Orientada a Objetos (OOP)** course at _Universidad de Los Andes_. It allows users to efficiently select and rent cars, with built-in logic for managing availability, rental periods, and customer input. The application is entirely Java-based and does not rely on external technologies.
